# The Liri Node Text Recognition App 5000

With Liri, you can give our (somewhat) smart Node.js-based command line tool a movie or song and it'll fetch you some cool data on both! It can also look into your tweets as well! How nifty!

## Getting Started

1) After cloning down the repo add an .env file to the root folder.
2) in the .env file add the following text with the proper keys from the Spoitify and Twitter API services:<br />
<br />
Spoitify API keys<br />
SPOTIFY_ID=*YOUR_KEY_HERE*<br />
SPOTIFY_SECRET=*YOUR_KEY_HERE*<br />
<br />
Twitter API keys<br />
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=*YOUR_KEY_HERE*<br />
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=*YOUR_KEY_HERE*<br />
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=*YOUR_KEY_HERE*<br />
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=*YOUR_KEY_HERE*<br />

## Prerequisites

Node.js - Without this Liri will not function. Not running makes Liri very sad. So make sure you have Node.

## Running Liri

1) Esnure that your terminal is running inside the root directory
2) Type in "node liri.js" and then one of the following commands: my-tweets, spotify-this-song <song title>, movie-this <movie title>, or do-what-it-says.
3) Watch the magic happen!
